# Custom_RDT_Protocol
A custom reliable data transfer protocol implemented in the application layer over UDP


To run:
    type make
    then simply use the format specified by the assignement requirements


Note:
    I worked on this for days and days and days, ultimately there was so much functionality to implement \
    I couldn't get it all working perfectly. There is seriously so much required for this assignment, it is insane. \
    Anyway, the program does transfer large text files though will sometimes small differences at the end of the file. \
